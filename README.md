# Hospital Stay Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on hospital stay data to identify key factors influencing patient stay duration. The dataset includes information on admission details, severity of illness, patient demographics, and hospital-related features. The goal is to analyze patterns, detect anomalies, and prepare data for predictive modeling.

## 📊 Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature encoding.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing relationships between patient characteristics and hospital stay duration.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transforming and scaling features for better model performance.
- **Predictive Modeling (Optional)**: Using machine learning to predict hospital stay duration.

## 📊 Data Insights
- **Severity of illness** has a strong correlation with hospital stay duration.
- **Emergency admissions** lead to significantly longer hospital stays.
- **Outliers detected** in visitor numbers and admission deposits.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mahmoudshawki24/Hospital_Stay_Analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Hospital_Stay_Analysis
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook EDA_CODING.ipynb
   ```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data processing)
